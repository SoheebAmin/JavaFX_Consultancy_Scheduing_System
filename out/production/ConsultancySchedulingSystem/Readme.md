# Java Consultancy Application v1.01 #

## Usage ##

This is an appointment scheduling application that allows the user (presumably in the role of an employee at this hypothetical company) to manage customer and appointment records, as found in a live mySQL database.

## Current Version ##

In its current state, the application can manage all scheduling of customers and appointments, without allowing any overlaps. It also displays the tableview times in the default system timezone of the user.

The office hours of this hypothetical company are in EST. So, the user will only see EST office hours when scheduling an appointment. 

## Reports ##

Aside from the reports of showing appointments by month, type, and contact, the application also allows the user to view all reports in whatever US of their choosing via the combo box drop down list.
